#### Why Fuse ?

Fuse-box is a wonderful bundler with ultra fast caching system.
It keep simplicity and do not break things between versions.
It has a wonderful Hot Module Realoading management which is perfect for React !
Works also well with Typescript and is coded in Typescript.


#### Why Typescript ?

Typescript add what's is missing in Javascript. Typings !
A lot of libraries static types are available in [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped), so no excuse :)
With a great IDE, we also have auto-complete and error showing while typing code.
More important : It allows teams to work on different parts of a same project and avoid errors.
Developers of your team can make interfaces / classes and enums so no need to search into a doc to be sure about that parameter name.  
Also, Typescript is a static version of ECMA, and will evolve along with it, not create a new language.


#### Why React ?

**WIP**


#### Why Less ?

**WIP**


#### Which IDE ?

We love PHPStorm ! This IDE is wonderful for front-end projects and speaks React / Typescript and PHP. 
~~Default PHPStorm config is already embedded so you don't have to configure it with each projects.~~
Other IDE can also work well thanks to Typescript :)

#### About me

[Solid Fuse Base](https://github.com/solid-js/fuse-base) and [Solidify Lib](https://github.com/solid-js/solidify) are projects maintained by [Alexis Bouhet](https://github.com/zouloux), lead developer at [Cher Ami](http://cher-ami.tv/).
Started with Flash and Adobe Air, then mobile and Javascript, making websites and applications since more than 10 years now. 
I try to integrate recurring tasks from my [professional and personal](http://zouloux.com) projects into this Framework and Workflow.
I want to keep things simple and avoid to the maximum common mistakes a team can make.


#### Future

This project is meant to stay at human scale and will not grow a lot more than this.
Features will be added when needed several websites or webapp projects. Older features will be removed but will still be available with tags and branches.
Feel free to contact me for more info or observation !
